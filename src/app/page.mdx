## Big fun Autel Care plan "mix-up". {{ date: '2025-05-18T00:00Z' }}

As I started to truly fall in love with the Autel Evo II 640T despite the horrendus sales experience, I came to learn during my care plan activation that DSLRPros mis-configured my order. In the screenshot you'll notice the issue. They configured the care plan for the RTK varient yet sold me the Enterprise version. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Notes:

- You guessed it, hosed yet again! Users have 48 hours post controller activation to register the care plan otherwise the plan is void. 
- My activation was already fraught to begin with. Thankfully Autel direct has been helpful but being a middleman between an OEM and DSLRPros has been exhausting.
- Do I have in my possetion a $6K uninsurable drone? Currently that seems to be the case. Awaiting support response...
- I also realized that the configured order and summary pages (driven by Shopify) have been manually removed. Gotta get screenshots when you can folks!

## Hardware Swap Reality {{ date: '2025-05-16T00:00Z' }}

Worked with an Autel Robotics tech (also fullfills DNerds sales as a side hustle *wink*) on the Enterprise to RTK varient swap to support prop guards. Wow, what a cluster.

### <SparkleIcon /> Notes

- Once again I had to force-feed product facts to a rep. In this case it was the fact that the Enterprise variant has larger blades. "No no no" I was told. :: very awkward dialog where I onboard the rep with Enterprise varient facts (yet again) :: "It seems the Enterprise varient does indeed have larger blades". Ok, at least we're on same page.
- This meant that the original plan to swap to rugged RTK meant a prop swap as well otherwise the guard would not properly protect the blades given the enterprise blades are larger.
- I was encoraged to allow a swap of my Enterprise's arms (masterful pieces of carbon fiber artwork) to the rugged, shorter polycarbonate arms with smaller props with no credit. My question? "What does a CF Enterprise arm retail for vs. the rugged polycarbonate's arm?". That question was flat out ignored. I found out myself. A single Evo II 640T V3 Enterprise carbon fiber arm retails for over $600. The rugged's arm cost is under $200 for ALL FOUR!
- Suffice to say after all of the runaround I decided to kept the Enterprise vs let them strip it.

## 1-Day Shipping Upgrade = 6 Days @ DSLRPros  {{ date: '2025-05-13T00:00Z' }}

After being told a whopping 5 Enterprise bundles were in stock by DSLRPros, I was confident in upgrading the *free* shipping to 1 day for $69.25. I placed the order on the 6th and recieved the unit on the 13th. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Notes:

- Although I brought this up during the debacle cycle(s), I was never offered a refund.
- My goal at this point was to simply reach a common ground on Enterprise specifications. I happily ate the loss on shipping when we finally broke through to agree (based on published Autel docs) that the blades and arm housings were larger than the RTK rugged

## Prop guards are needed for my use case, agreed, thanks! {{  date: '2023-05-05T00:00Z' }}

After a truly delightful pre-sale conversation with DSLRPros I was confident I was on the right track and thrilled to recieve my drone. Based on my particular use-case, prop guards for my Evo II 640T Enterprise are necessary. I assumed at $6K they'd be included. Not a problem, Steven auto-added them to my quote. Sweet.

### <SparkleIcon /> Notes:

- The additional blades that Steven added were also useless and incompatible with the Enterprise variant.
- Guess when prop guards are suddently no longer needed at all? The exact moment they realized prop guards are not an option (at all) on the Enterprise version. I was literally told "You don't need them" post-sale.
